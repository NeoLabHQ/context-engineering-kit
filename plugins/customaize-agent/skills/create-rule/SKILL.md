## Claude Code guidlines

### Organize rules with `.claude/rules/`

For larger projects, you can organize instructions into multiple files using the `.claude/rules/` directory. This keeps instructions modular and easier for teams to maintain. Rules can also be [scoped to specific file paths](#path-specific-rules), so they only load into context when Claude works with matching files, reducing noise and saving context space.

<Note>
  Rules load into context every session or when matching files are opened. For task-specific instructions that don't need to be in context all the time, use [skills](/en/skills) instead, which only load when you invoke them or when Claude determines they're relevant to your prompt.
</Note>

#### Set up rules

Place markdown files in your project's `.claude/rules/` directory. Each file should cover one topic, with a descriptive filename like `testing.md` or `api-design.md`. All `.md` files are discovered recursively, so you can organize rules into subdirectories like `frontend/` or `backend/`:

```text  theme={null}
your-project/
├── .claude/
│   ├── CLAUDE.md           # Main project instructions
│   └── rules/
│       ├── code-style.md   # Code style guidelines
│       ├── testing.md      # Testing conventions
│       └── security.md     # Security requirements
```

Rules without [`paths` frontmatter](#path-specific-rules) are loaded at launch with the same priority as `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

#### Path-specific rules

Rules can be scoped to specific files using YAML frontmatter with the `paths` field. These conditional rules only apply when Claude is working with files matching the specified patterns.

```markdown  theme={null}
---
paths:
  - "src/api/**/*.ts"
---

# API Development Rules

- All API endpoints must include input validation
- Use the standard error response format
- Include OpenAPI documentation comments
```

Rules without a `paths` field are loaded unconditionally and apply to all files. Path-scoped rules trigger when Claude reads files matching the pattern, not on every tool use.

Use glob patterns in the `paths` field to match files by extension, directory, or any combination:

| Pattern                | Matches                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `**/*.ts`              | All TypeScript files in any directory    |
| `src/**/*`             | All files under `src/` directory         |
| `*.md`                 | Markdown files in the project root       |
| `src/components/*.tsx` | React components in a specific directory |

You can specify multiple patterns and use brace expansion to match multiple extensions in one pattern:

```markdown  theme={null}
---
paths:
  - "src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"
  - "lib/**/*.ts"
  - "tests/**/*.test.ts"
---
```

#### Share rules across projects with symlinks

The `.claude/rules/` directory supports symlinks, so you can maintain a shared set of rules and link them into multiple projects. Symlinks are resolved and loaded normally, and circular symlinks are detected and handled gracefully.

This example links both a shared directory and an individual file:

```bash  theme={null}
ln -s ~/shared-claude-rules .claude/rules/shared
ln -s ~/company-standards/security.md .claude/rules/security.md
```

#### User-level rules

Personal rules in `~/.claude/rules/` apply to every project on your machine. Use them for preferences that aren't project-specific:

```text  theme={null}
~/.claude/rules/
├── preferences.md    # Your personal coding preferences
└── workflows.md      # Your preferred workflows
```

User-level rules are loaded before project rules, giving project rules higher priority.
